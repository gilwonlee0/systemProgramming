## Overview

This phase of the project implements a simple shell program (`myshell`) in C. The shell supports only a single foreground command, along with a few built-in commands, such as cd or exit.

## Files

- `myshell.c`: Main source file with shell implementation.
- `csapp.c`: Utility functions.
- `Makefile`: Build configuration for the project.

## Build Instructions

```bash
make
./myshell
```
